"""Pin the export path's own numbers and fail when they drift.

The export summary's counters and the six main Parquet files (the checkpoint
tables too, under `--checkpoints`), checked three ways:

  1. CROSS-CHECK: the counters that are Parquet row counts
     (`cross_check_identities`) must equal them, baseline or not; a counter
     the summary did not print fails too. fields.parquet's is the sink's
     `Sink tally` fields (NetStats' `Fields:` counts framed properties only).
  2. MANIFEST: the counts the manifest publishes beside the summary
     (`MANIFEST_CHECKS`) must agree with it, and under `--checkpoints` every
     checkpoint GUID path must match the main stream's own declaration
     (`checkpoint_guid_crosscheck`).
  3. BASELINE: every counter and each file's rows, bytes and SHA-256 against
     a pinned JSON -- the data moving while the summary faithfully reports
     it. Bytes moving with every counter equal means the values moved, or
     the parquet crate did (Cargo.lock pins it).

The baseline names its replay by bare filename, resolved against
VRFKIT_CORPUS_DIR; a missing replay is SKIPPED unless --require-input or
VRFKIT_REQUIRE_CORPUS is set.

Usage:
    python tools/check_export_baseline.py --baseline tools/baselines/export_02d4d478.json
    python tools/check_export_baseline.py --baseline <path> --update
